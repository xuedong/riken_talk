# PhD Defense

This repository contains the slides that I used for the defense of my PhD, which is about _Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Behavioural Planning in Autonomous Driving_. It is powered by [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).

* See the [slides :page_facing_up:](https://eleurent.github.io/phd-defense/) online.

## Usage

The slides are in simple HTML/CSS/JS, and there are several ways to visualize them.

### Locally

You can simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your favourite browser.

### Github pages

If you fork this repository on github, you can enable [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) in the repository setting, and github will produce a static webpage that will be automatically updated after every commit.

### Personal server

I chose to automatically upload the slides on a personal server, using the [scp](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action) [github action](https://github.com/features/actions).
