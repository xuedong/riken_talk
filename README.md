# RIKEN AIP Talk

This repository contains the slides that I used for my talk at RIKEN AIP, which is about _Bayesian Best-Arm Identification_. It is powered by [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).

## Usage

The slides are in simple HTML/CSS/JS, and there are several ways to visualize them.

### Locally

You can simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your favourite browser.

### Github pages

If you fork this repository on github, you can enable [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) in the repository setting, and github will produce a static webpage that will be automatically updated after every commit.
